# Typescript

Typescript is a subset of JavaScript. That mean that all JavaScript ES5, 6 ... is valid typescript, but typescript add many useful features. The more important is the hard typing but not only.

Like ES6 and all new JavaScript brand, it needs to be compiled to current JavaScript so that actual browsers can interpret it.
