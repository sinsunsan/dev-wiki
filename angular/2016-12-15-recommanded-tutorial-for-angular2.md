## Observables / RxJS

Angular 2 adopted this new concept of observable which basically is a more advanced form of promise. RxJs is the implementation of Observable used by angular which is being developed by Microsoft.

* This post list 3 common problems with can have with observable.
* **Pitfall 1** : not subscribing to an observable is similar to having a function but not exucuting it

> An observable itself is just a definition of a way to handle a stream of values. We can think of it as something close to a function. Creating an observable is somewhat similar to declaring a function, the function itself is just a declaration. Calling the function is something entirely different, as defining a function does not execute its code.
>
> We need to call the function in order for something to happen, and that is also the case with an Observable: we need to subscribe to it in order for it to work!

* Building a data store with observable [http://blog.angular-university.io/how-to-build-angular2-apps-using-rxjs-observable-data-services-pitfalls-to-avoid/](http://blog.angular-university.io/how-to-build-angular2-apps-using-rxjs-observable-data-services-pitfalls-to-avoid/)

*   Revision of what ngFor can do

    * how to get the index
    * how to track by another value that default (by object Identity)
    * using odd, even, last, first for dynamic class naming

    > ngFor by default tracks list items using object identity. This means that if you build a list of new objects from scratch with the exact same values as the previous list and pass this newly built list to ngFor, Angular will not be able to tell that a given list item is already present or not.

## Modules

Organize your code in a modular way. Import a module instead of importing a dozen of files (javascript modules). Despite of the use of ES6 modules in angular, angular modules @ngModules are still useful to bundle a feature or a shared utility together.
